## 🧮 Price Calculation Logic

The system implements sophisticated price calculation:

```typescript
// Effective Weight Calculation
effectiveWeight = netWeight × (1 + wastagePercent / 100)

// Metal Amount Calculation
metalAmount = effectiveWeight × metalRatePerGram

// Total Price Calculation
totalPrice = metalAmount + makingCharges + stoneValue
```

**Example:**
- Net Weight: 24.0g
- Wastage: 6%
- Rate: ₹6,500/g
- Making Charges: ₹8,000
- Stone Value: ₹5,000

```
Effective Weight = 24.0 × 1.06 = 25.44g
Metal Amount = 25.44 × 6,500 = ₹165,360
Total Price = ₹165,360 + ₹8,000 + ₹5,000 = ₹178,360
```
